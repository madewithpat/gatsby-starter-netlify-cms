## You Rock, Netlify

I am continually impressed at how easy to use this platform is. The UI is phenomenal, the UX is on point. I could gush for days (and probably will, no shame).

Full disclosure, though:

*I will have to compare my options.*

It's just my nature. It can't be avoided.

Sure, this Netlify CMS thing is awesome. But it isn't an API. And even among that crowd, there's no clear cut winner.

Contentful looks pretty great, and a lot of people seem to swear by it. But that first step in the pricing tier is a **doozy**.

GraphCMS is a much cheaper option, but how well does it work?

And then there's DatoCMS, which has a respectable market share.

So many options, so much JAM.

Until my next test

### Keep JAMmin', my friends
